How to Use This Program:
Run the program in a terminal/console that supports ANSI escape codes (most modern terminals do)

Enter a word when prompted

Choose an animation type (1-5)

Watch the animation!

Animation Types:
Bouncing word: The word bounces up and down

Growing word: The word grows and shrinks with spaces

Colorful word: Each character changes color in a rainbow pattern (may not work in all IDEs)

Typing animation: The word appears letter by letter, then disappears

Spinning word: The word rotates character by character

Note: The clearConsole() method might not work in all IDEs. If it doesn't work in your environment, you can replace it with printing multiple newlines (System.out.println("\n".repeat(50));) for a simpler effect.
